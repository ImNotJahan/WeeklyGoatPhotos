# WeeklyGoatPhotos
A google app script to send a photo stored in google drive to a list of emails


Originally designed for sending photos of goats, but it should work for any photos. Emails are sent individually instead of in batch.


Also, if you'd like to join the weekly goat email list, open an issue and I'll add you.
